# *Sorghum bicolor bicolor* Phenophase Bayesian Belief Network in R & Python

This project uses:

  - [Rocker Group](https://github.com/rocker-org)'s Tidyverse R 4.0 Ubuntu 18 LTS docker container image
  - data from the [TERRA-REF project](https://www.terraref.org/) accessed through the [traits](https://docs.ropensci.org/traits/) R package
  - [jags](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/) for Gibbs Sampled MCMC modeling
  - [causalnex](https://causalnex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to implement the `NO TEARS` directed acyclic graph structure learning algorithm as described [here](https://github.com/xunzheng/notears)
  - `causalnex` has dependencies: `pandas`, `sklearn`, and `igraph`

To develop a causal Bayesian network, also known as a Bayesian Belief Network,  predicting growth rate as a phenotype from the  *Sorghum bicolor* biomass accumulation panel.

This analysis produces a casual inference Bayesian Belief Network similar to Judea Pearle's [work](https://escholarship.org/content/qt53n4f34m/qt53n4f34m.pdf), where the nodes (vertices) of the network represent variables and the edges (arcs) represent linked dependencies supported by [conditional probailities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability#:~:text=In%20probability%20theory%2C%20conditional%20probability,or%20evidence%20has%20already%20occurred).

## Methods
### Docker Setup

To run any aspect of this analysis it is recommended that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on the host machine. Or use [singularity-ce](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases) to run the containers on high performance clusters.

### Running the Analyses with Docker

- All RScripts detailed below can be run with the container image [cyversevice/rstudio-bayes-cpu:4.0-ubuntu-jags](https://hub.docker.com/layers/cyversevice/rstudio-bayes-cpu/4.0-ubuntu-jags/images/sha256-5a9b4017fd234bf007e556da07c5eee58ad5a4d3c5d429529a731241afe2365c?context=explore), including the [growth rate modeling](https://github.com/genophenoenvo/JAGS-logistic-growth) 
- All python code will run in the command line with this Docker container [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rbartelme/pytorch-causalnex) and is written so that this repository is mounted as a volume in the container image as `/work/phenophasebbn/` 
  * Ex. `docker run --rm -it -v /local/path/to/phenophasebbn/:/work/phenophasebbn/ rbartelme/pytorch-causalnex:0.10.0 python /work/phenophasebbn/bbn/bbn_structure.py` (See note below)
  * The current Dockerfile for this image is contained in this repository at `/causal_nex/Dockerfile`
- A JupyterLab Docker container [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rbartelme/jupyterlab-pytorch-causalnex) has been created to facilitate the exploration of the python codebase

### Initial Graph Embedding

![Initial Graph](initial_concept.png)

In order to speed up the directed acyclic graph generation for the Bayesian Belief Network, an initial graph was instantiated using lists of tuples that reference the edge/node connections and directions outlined in the conceptual diagram above.

***NOTE:*** **Learning the graph structure without any expert knowledge graph encodings via the [NO TEARS](https://github.com/xunzheng/notears) implementation in [causalnex](https://causalnex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) *without* GPU acceleration is a computationally intensive process and may not solve the graph structure with the Sorghum gene data included in these analyses.**

### Network Workflow Description

How the contents of this repository were used to generate the analysis.

**1. Processing raw data:**
  - Weather & phenotype data processing:
    * Code: `/bnprocess_functional.R`
    - Exports (TSV): 
      * `/season4_combined.txt`
      * `/season6_combined.txt`
      * `/ksu_combined.txt` (No longer used in final analysis)
  - Genomic Data:
    * Code to process the SNP frequency by *Sorghum bicolor* gene table [from this repository](https://github.com/genophenoenvo/genomic_data) can be found in `/genomic_preprocessign/snp_normalization.R`
    - Exports (TSV):
      * `/genomic_preprocessing/genewise_snp_relative_abundance.txt` where the relative abundance of single nucleotide polymorphisms is calculated relative to the *Sorghum bicolor* biomass accumilation panel population
  - Development work: 
    * notes and pseudo code are in `/sandbox/` and `/bnprocess_mac.R`

**2. Model Growth Rate by *Sorghum bicolor* Cultivar using JAGS in R:**
  - `/jags/` contains the dev code for the growth rate modeling below, these scripts & files are used in the `bbn` structure learning model
  - Full [logistic growth rate modeling by Jessica Guo](https://github.com/genophenoenvo/JAGS-logistic-growth)
  - Summary plots of the logistic growth models can be found in `/data_figs/`
 
**3. Prepare dataset for structure learning in R & Python:**
  - Join genomic, environmental, and phenotypic data
    * This is done with the Rscript `/bbn/join_datasets.R`
  - Exports:
    * `/bbn/rgr_snp_joined.csv`

**4. BBN Structure Learning in Python with NO TEARS algorithm:**
  - Ingest joined data `/bbn/rgr_snp_joined.csv` and learns structure  with:
    * `/bbn/bbn_structure.py`
  - Process categorical data with `labelencoder` from `scikit-learn`
  - Encode expert knowledge into graph structure via a list of tuples in the first invocation of `StructureModel()`
    * `png` exported as `/bbn/init_graph.png` (as of 10-25-2021 this takes a long time to write the png and is commented out)
  - Improve graph structure with `NO TEARS` using the `from_pandas` function from `causalnex` blacklisting spurrious node + edge connections with a second list of tuples
  - Exports:
    * categorical label encodings for `genotype` (or cultivar) `/bbn/genotype_map.json` & `/bbn/season_map.json`
    * pickle of structure model as `/bbn/nt_sm`
    * `png` of directed acyclic graph as `/bbn/final_graph.png`

**5. Discritized Data Mapping & Conditional Probability Distribution Fitting:**
  - Import Bayesian Network by structure model pickle
  - Instantiate Bayesian network with `BayesianNetwork()` function from `causalnex`
  - Map continuous variables into categories
  -
